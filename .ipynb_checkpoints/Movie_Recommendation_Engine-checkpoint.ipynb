    "#### There are basically three types of recommender systems:-\n",

    "> *  **Demographic Filtering**- They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre. The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "> * **Content Based Filtering**- They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "> * **Collaborative Filtering**- This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts\n",

There are several candidates for this; such as the euclidean, the Pearson and the [cosine similarity scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity).
